\begin{abstract}
A review article explores the evolution of communication strategies from an engineering manager to a CEO, shedding light on challenges faced when interacting with upper management. Early frustrations stemmed from perceived disconnect between non-technical aspects of the business and technical initiatives. With organizational growth, inherent complexity demands strategic communication. \\

The transition to a CEO role unveiled a two-fold challenge: competing demands for attention and the need for more effective communication. Tips for executive communication and presentations are distilled for graduate-level consideration. The granularity of conversations should align with company size, emphasizing independence in managing tactical concerns while communicating broader themes. Proactive communication is crucial, urging managers to push updates even in non-crisis situations. In larger companies, bursty updates serve as valuable reminders. A three-step communication process with executives is outlined, emphasizing clarity and a structured approach. \\

Writing a narrative before presentations aids in identifying gaps and considering diverse perspectives. The article advises against evasiveness, preparing for unexpected questions, and utilizing data for a results-oriented approach. The importance of leading meetings with a clear goal is highlighted, respecting executive time and favoring clarity over ambiguity. These strategies collectively form a comprehensive guide for effective executive communication and leadership amidst organizational growth.

the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.

For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
\cite{ref_article1,ref_lncs1,ref_book1},
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.
